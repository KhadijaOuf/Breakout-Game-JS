# Breakout-Game-JS
My first 'Breakout' game, built entirely with JavaScript and no framework, rendered using the HTML5 canvas. I followed the tutorial as a guide and added some enhancements, including styling the victory/lose messages, displaying the life counter as hearts, and adding sound effects to make the game more dynamic and engaging.
